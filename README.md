# neirosuicide

Hello! This is a small cli program on python. You can speak to a "bot", and make it commit suicide, if you mentally press it too much.

first argument: choose text or voice input and output. Using google recognition and system

second argument: choose level of depression (default is 0). death is 10

also edit .env file. if you want to use openai, you need to set up an api key in OPENAI_API_KEY variable and set USE_AI to true.

it also automatically connects to your wifi Yeelight bulb to change colors. hehehe

Have fun!
